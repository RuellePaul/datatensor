# About Datatensor

Datatensor is a web application to prepare and manage image datasets for `object detection`, using an existing dataset or creating your own from scratch.

## What is object detection

Object detection is the task of detecting instances of objects of a certain class within an image. The state-of-the-art methods can be categorized into two main types: one-stage methods and two stage-methods. One-stage methods prioritize inference speed, and example models include YOLO, SSD and RetinaNet. Two-stage methods prioritize detection accuracy, and example models include Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN.

The most popular benchmark is the MSCOCO dataset. Models are typically evaluated according to a Mean Average Precision metric (mAP).

## What can I achieve with Datatensor

On this site, you can use our integrated tools to :

- Create your own dataset
- Upload thousands of images
- Label your images
- Augment your images (without having to label the generated images)
- Export your datasets for use in your object detection applications.

> Datatensor doesn't assume anything about your technical stack: also, the exported datasets can train any kind of object detection model.
