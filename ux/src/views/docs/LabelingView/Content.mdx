# Images labeling

Start by creating the different `categories` of objects you want to detect. In our example, these are the three dog species :

- cardigan
- malamute
- malinois

You can then use the labeling tool by clicking on an image. Find the next image to label by clicking on "Next unlabeled".

The bounding boxes - or `labels` - should enclose (ideally to the nearest pixel) the object(s) to be detected. Use the keyboard shortcuts for more efficiency.

Right click on a label to change its category or delete it.

> It is also possible to label images on a mobile or tablet, but it is more comfortable to be on a widescreen computer.

Once all your images are labeled, you can augment your dataset.
