# Upload images

Upload images of objects you want to detect on your dataset.

<video src="/static/images/docs/upload_images.mp4" />

<Paragraph>You should have at least {MIN_LABELS_WARNING_EXPORT} labels per category (including labels on augmented images), so you should have at least several hundred images per object to detect.</Paragraph>

You can upload `.jpg` or `.png` images. Datatensor will convert and compress images for an optimal result on the training of a detection model.

> On your dataset images, the objects to be detected must be in different contexts of positioning and lighting to obtain better results.
