# Upload images

Upload images of objects you want to detect on your dataset.

<img src="/static/images/docs/upload_images.gif" alt="Upload images" />

You should have at least `2000 labels per category` (including labels on augmented images), so you should have at least several hundred images per object to detect.

You can upload `.jpg` or `.png` images. Datatensor will convert and compress images for an optimal result on the training of a detection model.

> On your dataset images, the objects to be detected must be in different contexts of positioning and lighting to obtain better results.
